Hi!
I’m a Consultant working on IMX500 Intelligent Vision Sensor at SONY.

Prior to that, I was an Associate Data Scientist at Activa Inc. India, where I helped to build the autoML tool for forecasting the time series data.
In Summer 2019, I interned at Activa Inc. Where I help to build Object Detection Model to detect the cracks in the aeroplane engine using Boroscope device.

I completed my MTech. in IT at Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, where I was advised by Prof. Tuhina Samantha in the field of wireless sensor network (WSNs), working on fault detection algorithms for wireless sensor networks.

I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics & Communication Engg. at Uttar Pradesh Technical University.
